# Mapping
A portfolio on mapping and analysis. Sample digitising, georeferencing and geospatial analysis are captured


### Digitising roads to provide an insight on nature of roads,their purpose  and use
 
 - Software: QGIS ,Google Maps,Excel
 - Analysis: Link-node ratio
 - File format: shapefile
 - Insight: Attribute provides detailed information on all types of roads, their length and how best to navigate area using link-node ratio.

An area after being digitised looks like this

 ## Navigating through an area using google maps and digitising building information in an atttribute table
- Software: QGIS, Google Maps, Excel
- Analysis:  Building, Use and Style
- File Format : shapefile
- Insight: Knowing all building types, use and style in an area for taxation purposes, urban densification, greening, construction etc. 

An area after being digitised looks like this

## Georeferencing a pdf map on planning policy and generating separate geopackages of available layers 
- Software: QGIS, Excel
- Analysis: Planning Policy
- File Format: Geopackage
- Insight: Providing coverage of area w.r.t. a planning layer or map
